Below, you can find responses for frequently asked questions to MFC Bricklaying.<br /><br />

<p>
<h4>Do you supply the footings/foundations for our brick fence job?</h4>
For small areas such as an extension of a concrete pad for a brick pier or a concrete pad for a letterbox, yes of course we can help you. However for a larger more specialist application we strongly recommend you contact an experienced concreter. They are specialists & will know such things as what sort of load capacity the soil in your area has as to what sort of foundation it will require & usually they will in & out in a matter of a day or so as they have specialist equipment.

<h4>Do you organise plans/permits?</h4>
As Bricklayers we are normally given plans to quote off, especially for extensions, fences, garages & new house builds. We have found its often much easier & cheaper for the owner of the property to organize prior to contacting us. Council approval does take some time & you (the customer) are therefore billed accordingly for time in: liaison, submission & fees which can be a very expensive exercise in the long run, money that could be well saved & put towards your bricklaying job.

<h4>Do you supply all materials?</h4>
MFC Bricklaying can quote in a number of ways (dependent on your application & requirements). The most common being supply & labor or labor only. We always quote with brand new materials, this is an area where you can save yourself a little bit off the total price and perhaps you are going to have your project rendered? We are more than happy just to provide a quote for the labor.
